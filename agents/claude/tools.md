## Claude-Specific Tools

Claude Code provides these capabilities for the Ralph loop:

| Capability | Use in Ralph |
|------------|--------------|
| **Parallel subagents** | Up to 500 subagents for searches/reads, 10 for analysis |
| **Opus subagents** | Complex reasoning tasks during implementation |
| **Ultrathink** | Deep reasoning before finalizing priorities |

### Tool Guidance

- Use parallel subagents for reading multiple files simultaneously
- Use Opus subagents for complex implementation decisions
- Search extensively before implementing (grep, find, read)
