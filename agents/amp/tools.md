## Amp-Specific Tools

Amp provides specialized tools that enhance the Ralph loop:

| Tool | Use in Ralph |
|------|--------------|
| **Oracle** | Planning, gap analysis, architecture review, debugging |
| **Librarian** | Reading library docs, understanding external dependencies |
| **Task** | Parallel subagent work for independent operations |
| **finder** | Semantic codebase search (replaces grep-chaining) |
| **todo_write** | Track task progress within each iteration |

### Tool Guidance

- **Oracle**: Consult for architectural decisions, plan review, and debugging complex failures
- **Librarian**: Use when working with external libraries to understand APIs and patterns
- **finder**: Semantic search by functionality or concept, not just text matching
- **Task**: Run parallel subagents for independent file operations
- **todo_write**: Track subtasks within each iteration for visibility
