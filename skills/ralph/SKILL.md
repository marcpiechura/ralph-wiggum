# Ralph Wiggum Loop Generator

Generate the complete Ralph Wiggum loop infrastructure for iterative AI-driven development.

## When to Use

- When starting a new feature that needs iterative AI development
- When you want to set up autonomous development loops
- When you need to generate specs and implementation plans from feature docs

## What It Creates

All files are generated in the **project's root folder**:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specs/*.md` | Feature specs (one topic per file) |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Prioritized task list |
| `PROMPT_plan.md` | Planning mode instructions |
| `PROMPT_build.md` | Building mode instructions |

## Usage

Provide a path to a feature document, or let it auto-discover in `docs/`:

```
/skill ralph docs/my-feature.md
/skill ralph
```

After the skill generates the files, run the ralph binary:

```bash
ralph build     # Execute tasks from the plan
ralph auto      # Re-plan then build
```

## Amp-Specific Features

This skill leverages Amp's unique tools:
- **Oracle**: For planning, gap analysis, and debugging
- **Librarian**: For reading library documentation
- **finder**: For semantic codebase search
- **Task**: For parallel subagent work
