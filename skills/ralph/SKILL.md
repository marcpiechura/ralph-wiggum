# Ralph Wiggum Loop Generator

Generate the complete Ralph Wiggum loop infrastructure for iterative AI-driven development.

## When to Use

- When starting a new feature that needs iterative AI development
- When you want to set up autonomous development loops
- When you need to generate specs and implementation plans from feature docs

## What It Creates

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `specs/*.md` | Feature specs (one topic per file) |
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` | Prioritized task list |
| `PROMPT_plan.md` | Planning mode instructions |
| `PROMPT_build.md` | Building mode instructions |
| `loop.sh` | The bash loop script |

## Usage

Provide a path to a feature document, or let it auto-discover in `docs/`:

```
/skill ralph docs/my-feature.md
/skill ralph
```
